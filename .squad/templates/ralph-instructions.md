# Ralph Instructions
<!-- User-owned: customize this file to override Ralph's autonomous-execution behavior.
     squad init creates this file on first install; squad upgrade never overwrites it. -->

<!--
  PURPOSE
  -------
  When `.squad/ralph-instructions.md` exists, `squad watch --execute` instructs the
  spawned Copilot session to read this file and follow ALL sections here instead of
  the built-in fallback prompt.  If the file is absent, the built-in prompt is used.

  CONTRACT (stable — safe to build on)
  --------------------------------------
  YOU CAN  customize via this file:
    • Extra instructions given to Ralph at session start (Teams/Slack notifications,
      calendar checks, post-task hooks, MCP-powered side effects, escalation paths)
    • Additional eligibility rules or priority ordering for issue selection
    • Agent persona, tone, or verbosity for session output

  YOU CANNOT override via this file:
    • The four-agent concurrency ceiling or fail-closed batching requirement
    • Core eligibility filter (squad/squad:* label required, not blocked, not assigned)
    • The underlying `gh` / Copilot CLI command used to spawn each session

  TRUST IMPLICATIONS
  ------------------
  This file is read by the spawned Copilot session with full agent permissions.
  Treat it like code — never paste untrusted content here.  Anyone with write access
  to this file can influence what the agent does on your behalf.

  If this file is missing or empty, `squad watch --execute` falls back to the
  built-in prompt with no behavioral change.

  PLACEHOLDERS
  ------------
  The following values are injected by execute.ts before the session reads this file:
    (none currently — Ralph builds the issue list dynamically at runtime)

  FORMAT
  ------
  Plain markdown.  Structure with ## sections.  The spawned session reads the whole
  file, so keep it concise — one screen of instructions is ideal.
-->

## Ralph, Go!

Read this file for your full instructions.  Follow ALL sections.
Process actionable issues in priority order using batches of at most four agents.
Queue overflow for later batches. If the executor cannot enforce batching, return
`status: needs-decision` with the issue list and stop automatic spawning.

### Issue Selection

Work on every open, unblocked, unassigned issue labeled `squad` or `squad:{member}`.
Skip issues that are assigned to a human, blocked, or marked `status:on-hold`.

### Post-Task Actions

<!-- Uncomment and customize to add post-task hooks, e.g. Teams notifications:

After completing work on each issue:
- Post a brief summary to the team channel via your Teams MCP tool.
- Update the issue with a progress comment if no PR has been opened yet.
-->

### Escalation

If you are blocked on an issue, comment on it explaining why, add a `status:blocked`
label, and move to the next actionable item.  Do not halt the loop.

For each work item, freeze scope, authorized files, and measurable acceptance criteria before
execution. Give every spawned task a 20-minute timeout (never more than 30), its remaining
3-cycle/2-review/1-replacement budgets, and fail-closed stop behavior. New discoveries become
separate follow-up items. Timeout, stall, or cap exhaustion returns `status: needs-decision`
with attempted evidence and stops further automatic spawning for that item.
